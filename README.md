# Glean Indexing and Search APIs
## Overview
We will provide the candidate access to the SE Sandbox as a user-only. Prompt sent to the candidate prior the interview.

This is an exercise where you’ll have a hands-on exercise with Glean. This will cover Glean Indexing APIs. You will be given a week to complete your work from the time you are given this prompt. 

The required ask is indexing 50 documents of your choice via Glean Indexing API (https://developers.glean.com). During the interview session, you will present your understanding of the APIs and show you have indexed the documents into the Glean platform by searching for them.

# Glean Technical Services | Collaborative Exercise
## Overview
We are eager to learn more about how you will approach your new role in the Solution Architect
Team at Glean. We would like to know how you will approach a few likely customer scenarios
you will encounter in your time with Glean.

We understand that you may not have access to Glean currently and there are resources online
which can help you understand our product better.

We would like you to prepare a set of slides or a document which you can share and walk
through with us during the discussion. Do not provide any non-confidential or current/prior
company-specific information. The discussion is expected to be interactive, so you should ask
questions and state your assumptions throughout the presentation.

## Scenario 1 (Solutions Architect):
The panel you are speaking with is the technical and security team at an existing Glean
customer which is a large company with 5,000 employees and dozens of systems which have
already been integrated into Glean for their users. They have requested that we provide 2
major customizations to their existing deployment:

1. Add a new custom datasource for their custom sales CRM data (similar to Salesforce)
2. Integrate our search with an existing internal support chatbot solution (similar to
Intercom).

Without having extensive knowledge of the Glean technical architecture or solution
stack, propose how you would achieve these integrations with a document or
presentation. It is perfectly fine to speculate on capabilities that the source and
destination systems may have.

Include the following items to walk the panel team through:
* High level integration component and flow diagram (block and arrow diagram is
fine)
* Technical assumptions about the customer systems and Glean (list of
assumptions)
* Integration method you would leverage to connect the systems (light details on
what methods you would use and why)
* Resources required on both sides of the integration: technical and people (list of
resources and what they would be used for)
* Rough project plan to complete the work including design, build, test, implement
(high-level project phases and list of tasks in those phases)

When you start your presentation with the panel, introduce yourself as working for Glean and
provide context for your presentation with the audience before you share your screen and
present and walk through your document.
